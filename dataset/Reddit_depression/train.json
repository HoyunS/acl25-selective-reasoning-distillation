        "So I've been meeting my therapist for a year now. And in terms of progress, there have been some revelations on my part. But first let me tell from the very beginning. When I visit her for the first time,  all I could think of is how I shouldn't be there. It was weird telling a complete stranger about the issues I have been hiding constantly. Opening up to her took so much of my mental willpower. But few weeks of meeting her, I felt much calmer and it felt like I can breath for a moment. Everything was okay for a while. I can do my work, took more care of myself, and talk much more happier with my friends and loved ones. Then all of the sudden, it came. My usual episodes of depression came back. It hit much harder because maybe, its been lying dormant since I ignored it. And when I finally feel happy, it strikes back. So I told my therapist about it. She told me to use mindfulness. Instead of focusing on those thoughts, think of them objectively. I followed her advice and tried to use that for a few weeks. And well it works. But it works on making my depression worse. I told her again how I felt and it justs worse.  And then she said it. \"It seems you don't make an effort\". And I just sat there. Everything becomes quiet. She didn't seem to notice and kept going. \"If you don't make an effort, there will be no result. There are already tools provided to you but you won't use it. Are you trying to do the easy way? But you have to accept it even if you don't like it.\" I didn't say anything back. Because I can't. Her words felt like knives. Because those words sound exactly how my family, friends,  and other people told me. Her words sounds like those people who said that they can help me but then judge me when they knew my issues. The main reason why I always have to hide my feelings inside. Then Covid came. We have to use online therapy sessions. Now I only told her what I want her to hear. I closed up again. At one point I thought maybe I should change therapist, but if the same thing happened again, I don't know if I should even bother. Drugs did come into the discussion with her, but I fear the effects of the drugs will make me worse. So here it is. My story. If in the end, this makes me sound like a whiny bitch, I guess I am. I have accepted that I am a lost cause and can never be better.",

        "I care too much about what people think about me and this hinders me from doing great things in life. I was bullied during my middle school and it turned out really bad that I begged my mom to enroll me in another school which she did not concur. Every time I came home, I always ask myself like what's wrong with me? is there anything wrong with me? It was really traumatic. Their words stay. The bullying was continuous not until my senior year.    Amid the bullying, I decided to please people. I thought this was a great idea to calm the situation. When I saw them being pleased to things or even people in my class like the pretty ones and the smart ones, I observed them. I applied what I had seen. I started to do these stupid things just to please them. I gave them my allowance, presents during the Christmas party (this event occurs every December in my school), agreeing to their opinions even though I disagree with it, etc. As I have said, the bullying stopped when senior year came but the objective of pleasing a person stayed.   Majority of what I did were based from what the people liked. My whole high school year was basically pleasing people and pretending I liked doing these things. When it was the time to prepare for college, I started to get confused. I didn't really know what to do with my life because I've been depending on other people's opinion for a long time. Today, I am still stuck in this fucking hellhole. I just want to start living for myself.",

        "Every day I feel out of control. I have few thoughts. I rarely do anything outside of pure impulse. I don¡¯t know who I am anymore. I don¡¯t think about the future, and I don¡¯t think about the past. I am present in the worst way.   I don¡¯t have plans. Yet, I don¡¯t want to die and would like to continue existing. I¡¯m not sad, and I don¡¯t feel empty or numb. It¡¯s like there isn¡¯t a person underneath me. I feel like a computer made of flesh responding to the stimulus around it.  I still feel things. I love my pets. And I love my wife and son. I talk, I¡¯m pleasant, I¡¯m attentive and affectionate. But when they leave the room I¡¯m gone.",

        "Hello everyone! Like the title suggests I am looking for a Kingdom Hearts roleplayer for long term plots. My interests and Requirements are as follows:  \\-Please be over 18. NSFW may occur so it is strictly 18+ only. Lie about it you will be blocked.  \\-Please be comfortable with brain storming and assisting with ideas and plotting. Not looking to do all of this by myself.  \\-I do have some head canons and intend to use them, if you are only looking for people who go by the book on the game or manga I am probably not for you. Canon does need some creative liberties otherwise it turns into literally acting out the manga or game and I do not want that.  \\-I am expecting you can roleplay multiple characters, I will be as well. OCs are allowed as long as you can at least help me with playing canon characters.  \\- All types of ships are allowed, but I will primarily be focusing on mxm, if you do not like mxm please do not respond to this posting.  \\-Looking for experienced roleplayers only please, I am not here to teach you how to rp. I want to be able to hop into this, get to know you, set up, and go.  \\-I only rp using the first 4 games in the series: 1, 2, Chain of memories, and 358/2 Days. I am not interested in anything else, sorry.  If this looks interesting to you and you are looking for an interesting KH plot, PM me and we can move to Discord. Have a great day!",

        "I have a 55 gallon tank that needs to be leveled. It's off by quite a bit - the bubble in the level is outside the lines and the water level is visibly higher in the front.  Does anyone know if using shims will work? I wasn't sure if they'd hold up with roughly 500 lbs sitting on them. Is there another way I should be doing this? I just want to make sure I do this correctly since I have to take all of my fish, gravel, etc. out of the tank and I don't want to have to do this more than once. I also don't want a massive flood. Thanks in advance!",
