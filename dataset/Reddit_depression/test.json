        "How many months of rent did you have? Other than rent/transportation, what expenses did you account for? What about contingency? If you had student debt, what did you budget for it? I’ve tried Googling around, but I’d really like to know what people realistically have done.  Context: I’m from a DMV suburb and will be completing my undergraduate degree (from a university in DC) soon. I plan to live at home right after college (and probably work in DC) to pay down some student debt and save up, but my home environment is not very healthy so I’d like to move out as soon as I can.   I know it’ll be costly, but I’d prefer to live alone in a relatively safe neighborhood with generally close access to the Metro. I heard that I should wait to see where I can get a job in order to choose a location, but let me know if you have any advice regarding that too.  Thanks for reading, I’d appreciate any insight/advice you can provide!",

        "Just like the title suggests, it's really hard for me to process. Dealing with the fact I struggle with BPD, anxiety, and depression, I really feel like the world is going against me. I will admit, I'm really proud of how I'm handling things though. My boyfriend told me the situation at work tonight, and we changed plans in a blink of an eye. I've also managed to get some hours back when I requested the weekend off at work. Overall, I'm really stressed and I'm trying to be productive rather than sink into my old ways. I just need some good vibes, and to hope I'm doing things right.",

I realised that it had gone too far and tried to calm things down and apologise but he just continued to insult me and be an arsehole, and he turned all of my other friends against me as well. Now I can't do anything but lie in bed and hope that he realises his mistakes and fixes the damage he's done to my relationships with my friends",
